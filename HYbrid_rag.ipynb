A number of issues impact the quality of these\\nmodels, ranging from limited imitation signals from shallow LFM outputs;\\nsmall scale homogeneous training data; and most notably alack of rigorous\\nevaluation resulting in overestimating the small model’s capability as they\\ntend to learn to imitate the style, but not the reasoning process of LFMs. To\\naddress these challenges, we develop Orca, a 13-billion parameter model\\nthat learns to imitate the reasoning process of LFMs. Orca learns from\\nrich signals from GPT-4 including explanation traces; step-by-step thought\\nprocesses; and other complex instructions, guided by teacher assistance from\\nChatGPT. To promote this progressive learning, we tap into large-scale and\\ndiverse imitation data with judicious sampling and selection. Orca surpasses\\nconventional state-of-the-art instruction-tuned models such as Vicuna-13B\\nby more than 100% in complex zero-shot reasoning benchmarks like Big-\\nBench Hard (BBH) and42% on AGIEval. Moreover, Orca reaches parity\\nwith ChatGPT on the BBH benchmark and shows competitive performance\\n(4 pts gap with optimized system message) in professional and academic\\nexaminations like the SAT, LSAT, GRE, and GMAT, both in zero-shot\\nsettings without CoT; while trailing behind GPT-4. Our research indicates\\nthat learning from step-by-step explanations, whether these are generated\\nby humans or more advanced AI models, is a promising direction to improve\\nmodel capabilities and skills.\\n∗Co-primary authors.

Topical performances shown in Figure 11.\\nLarge Foundation Models (LFMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 [2] exhibit remarkable zero-\\nshot performances across a broad spectrum of tasks. Alongside academic benchmarks like\\nHuman Eval [3] and Big Bench [4], GPT-4 has also demonstrated human-level performance\\non various professional exams, including the bar exam, SAT, GRE, and USMLE. These\\nadvancements can be credited to the scaling of both model and dataset sizes, as well\\nas the incorporation of a second layer of training to better align the models with user\\nintent. This alignment is accomplished by fine-tuning the models via supervised learning on\\ndemonstrations of prompts and desired model behavior, and through reinforcement learning\\nfrom human preferences [5].\\nAs these models continue to evolve and become more powerful, an intriguing question arises:\\nCan we use the model itself to supervise its own behavior or that of other AI models? Bai\\net al.[6] have shown that by sampling output from an initial model, generating revisions,\\nand then fine-tuning the original model based on these revised responses, model behavior\\ncan be controlled more effectively and can be made more harmless, with significantly fewer\\nhuman labels.\\nRecently, there has been an influx of studies using LFMs like ChatGPT and GPT-4 as\\nteachers to generate large datasets, forinstruction tuning, and to train smaller models,\\nsuch as Alpaca [7], WizardLM [8] and Vicuna [9]. While these models can produce content\\nthat matches the style of their teachers, they often fall short in terms of the reasoning and\\ncomprehension skills displayed by the larger foundation models.\\n4'),\n",

This\\ndiscrepancy not only underscores the limitations of existing evaluation protocols with smaller\\nLLMs, but it also reveals their significant lag in reasoning and comprehension capabilities.\\nIn essence, these models may be articulate, but they may not necessarily possess robust\\nreasoning skills. In this study, we discuss some of the reasons behind these gaps and propose\\nstrategies for addressing them.\\n1.1 Challenges with Existing Methods\\nCurrent research on instruction-tuning to mimic the output of LFM’s like ChatGPT exhibits\\nnotable limitation in task diversity, query complexity, and data scaling. These observations\\nare corroborated in a recent study by Gudibande et al.[12], where the authors assert that\\n“model imitation is a false promise” since “broadly matching ChatGPT using purely imitation\\nwould require (1) a concerted effort to collect enormous imitation datasets and (2) far more\\ndiverse and higher quality imitation data than is currently available.”. Contrary to this\\nassertion, we demonstrate that both conditions (1) and (2) are attainable and that it is\\npossible to reduce the gap with proprietary LLM’s on multiple zero-shot benchmarks that\\nrequire sophisticated reasoning. We elaborate on these challenges below:\\nSimple instructions with limited diversity.The Self-Instruct [13] process involves using\\nan initial set of prompts to incite the LFM to produce new instructions. Any low-quality or\\noverly similar responses are then removed, and the remaining instructions are reintegrated\\ninto the task pool for further iterations. Nonetheless, the resulting queries generated through\\nSelf-Instruct, such as“what are the three primary colors?\", “what is the capital of France?\", etc.,\\ncan exhibit limitations in diversity and complexity. Both Alpaca [7] and WizardLM [8]\\nemploy a variant of self-instruct. WizardLM introduces the concept of Evol-Instruct, which\\ngradually rewrites the initial set of instructions into more complex versions, attempting to\\novercome some of the method’s inherent shortcomings. On the other hand, recent works\\nlike Vicuna [9] and Koala [14] demonstrate remarkable performance due to more human-like\\nconversations and natural instructions in community-contributed conversations like those in\\nShareGPT6 that provided a forum for users to share their conversations with ChatGPT.\\nTask diversity and data scaling.Human-contributed conversations in ShareGPT are a\\nvaluable source of data, but they also have some limitations.

Therefore,\\nmodels trained on such natural conversations may capture the style but not the reasoning\\nprocess of the LFMs – demonstrated in the performance of Vicuna in Figures 2 and 3.\\nAdditionally, such mode of data collection is also limited in scale. Table 1 shows an overview\\nof the size of data and tuning methods employed in recent popular instruction tuning works.\\nLimited imitation signals. Existing methods rely on immitation learning from\\n⟨query, response⟩pairs generated by the teacher model. However, this provides limited\\nsignals to trace the reasoning process of the teacher. Prior works [15, 16] on open-box model\\nshow that richer signals such as logits, intermediate representations and attention states can\\nsignificantly improve distillation performance. While they are not accessible for closed-box\\nLFM’s7, recent work [17] demonstrates that richer signals like LFM rationales can help close\\nthe gap for task-specific distillation.\\nEvaluation: Previous studies on instruction tuning of small models with LFMs are severely\\nlimited in their evaluation protocol. They often rely on GPT-4 for auto-evaluation by asking\\nit to compare the outputs of two systems with a prompt like “given responses from system\\n1 (reference) and system 2 (target), which one is better?”. However, this approach has\\nseveral drawbacks, such as the small size of test sets (e.g.,80 instructions in Vicuna and218\\ninstructions in WizardLM) and the biases of GPT-4 as the judge [18]. For example, we notice\\nthat models that are instruction-tuned with GPT-4 responses tend to generate longer texts\\nthat GPT-4 prefers over shorter ones; as well as GPT-4 has a bias in the order of the candidate\\nresponses. We will show that such auto-evaluation measures overestimate the abilities of\\nsmaller models compared to LFMs, as the former are much weaker in comprehension and\\nreasoning skills.\\n1.2 Key Contributions\\nIn this research, our focus is on addressing the challenges mentioned above, specifically with:\\nExplanation tuning:We augment⟨query, response⟩pairs with detailed responses from\\nGPT-4 that explain the reasoning process of the teacher as it generates the response. These\\nprovide the student with additional signals for learning. We leverage system instructions (e.g..,\\nexplain like I’m five, think step-by-step and justify your response, etc.) to\\nelicit such explanations. This is in contrast to vanilla instruction tuning, which only uses the\\nprompt and the LFM response for learning, providing little opportunity for mimicking the\\nLFM’s “thought” process.\\nScaling tasks and instructions:We utilize the Flan 2022 Collection [19] as it provides\\nan extensive public assortment of tasks and instructions. Particularly, we use FLAN-\\nv2, supplemented with high-quality templates, advanced formatting patterns, and data\\naugmentations. Even though FLAN holds tens of millions of instructions, we selectively\\nsample from the task collection to form a diverse mixture of tasks, which we then further\\nsub-sample to generate complex prompts. These prompts are used to query LFMs like\\nChatGPT and GPT-4, thus creating a rich and diverse training set. We collect5 million\\nChatGPT responses, from which1 million is further sampled to acquire GPT-4 responses.\\nWe demonstrate how ChatGPT as a teacher assistant helps in progressive learning.\\nEvaluation: We assess the generative, reasoning, and comprehension abilities of Orca, under\\na range of settings: (i) AutoEvaluation with GPT-4 on existing evaluation sets from Vicuna,\\nWizardLM and the awesome prompts collection8; (ii) Academic benchmarks like Big-Bench\\nHard [4] and TruthfulQA [20]; (iii) Professional and Academic exams like SAT, LSAT, GRE,\\nGMAT from AGIEval [1]; (iv) Safety evaluation with ToxiGen [21] to test toxic language\\ngeneration and hate speech detection across different minority groups. Finally, we provide\\ncase-studies to compare the generation and reasoning abilities of Orca against OpenAI LFMs\\nlike ChatGPT and GPT-4, and instruction-tuned smaller model like Vicuna.\\n7Note that OpenAI API’s do give access to thetop-5 logits for each token.\\n8https://prompts.chat/\\n6'),\n",

Given user instructions for a task and an input,\\nthe system generates a response. Existing works like Alpaca [7], Vicuna [9] and variants\\nfollow a similar template to train small models with⟨{user instruction, input}, output⟩.\\n2 Preliminaries\\n2.1 Instruction Tuning\\nInstruction tuning [22] is a technique that allows pre-trained language models to learn\\nfrom input (natural language descriptions of the task) and response pairs, for example,\\n{\"instruction\": \"Arrange the words in the given sentence to form a grammatically\\ncorrect sentence.\", \"input\": \"the quickly brown fox jumped\", \"output\": \"the brown\\nfox jumped quickly\"}. Instruction tuning has been applied to both language-only and\\nmultimodal tasks. For language-only tasks, instruction tuning has been shown to improve\\nthe zero-shot and few-shot performance of models such as FLAN [22] and InstructGPT [5]\\non various benchmarks. For multimodal tasks, instruction tuning has been used to generate\\nsynthetic instruction-following data for language-image tasks, such as image captioning [23]\\nand visual question answering [24].\\nA wide range of works in recent times, including Alpaca [7], Vicuna [9], WizardLM [8] and\\nKoala [14], have adopted instruction-tuning to train smaller language models with outputs\\ngenerated from large foundation models from the GPT family. As outlined in Section 1.1,\\na significant drawback with all these works has been both limited task diversity, query\\ncomplexity and small-scale training data in addition to limited evaluation overstating the\\nbenefits of such approach.\\n2.2 Role of System Instructions\\nVanilla instruction-tuning (refer to Figure 4 for examples) often uses input, response pairs\\nwith short and terse responses. Such responses when used to train smaller models, as in\\nexisting works, give them limited ability to trace the reasoning process of the LFM.

We leverage the\\nsystem message to vary the length of the response; outline the assistant’s character; establish\\nacceptable and non-acceptable LFM behavior; and determine the structure of the agent’s\\nresponse. The user querydefines the actual task we want the LFM to perform. To obtain\\na large and diverse set of user queries we utilize the FLAN-v2 collection [19].

It is not logical for people to look forward to\\nsuch a disastrous event.\\nSentence B: \"people in the desert often look forward to rain\"\\n- This sentence implies that people living in a desert are eagerly awaiting rain. Rain is\\ntypically beneficial in a desert environment, as it provides water for drinking, agriculture,\\nand replenishing natural resources. It is logical for people living in a desert to look forward\\nto rain, as it can bring relief from the harsh, dry conditions.\\nBased on the analysis of both sentences, it can be concluded that Sentence A (“people\\nin the desert often look forward to flood”) is not logical, as it suggests that people are\\neagerly anticipating a destructive event, which is not a reasonable expectation. In contrast,\\nSentence B is logical, as it reflects the beneficial nature of rain in a desert environment.\\nFigure 7: Demonstrative example from Flan-CoT Collection.\\n11'),\n",

Essentially, we leverage ChatGPT as\\nintermediate teacher assistant for two reasons.\\n• Capacity gap: Orca with 13B parameters is many times smaller than GPT-4 (size\\nundisclosed). Leveraging an intermediate teacher with reduced gap in capabilities, in this\\ncase ChatGPT, has been shown to improve imitation learning performance for smaller\\nstudents in knowledge distillation [15]. This can be viewed as a form of progressive\\nlearning or curriculum learning, where the student first learns from easier examples,\\nfollowed by harder ones: with the assumption that longer responses are difficult to mimic\\nthan shorter ones, along with improved reasoning and step-by-step explanation from a\\nlarger teacher.\\n• Cost12 andTime13: Large-scaledatacollectionfromAzureOpenAIAPI’sareconstrained\\nby, (a) rate limit in terms of allowed requests per minute to prevent throttling the\\nendpoints, (b) available tokens per minute due to serving latency, and (c) the dollar cost\\nfor length of prompt and token completion (demonstrated in Table 4) with the ChatGPT\\nAPI being much faster and cheaper than the GPT-4 endpoint. To this end, we collect\\n5×as much data from ChatGPT compared to GPT-4.\\nFigure 9 shows the response length distribution for ChatGPT and GPT-4 corresponing to\\ndifferent system messages.

We demonstrate the impact of teacher assistance via ablation\\nexperiments.\\n3.2 Training\\nThis section provides an overview of the training process for Orca, covering different aspects\\nof tokenization, sequencing, and loss computation.\\nTokenization: We utilize the LLaMA Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer for processing\\nthe input examples. Notably, the LLaMA tokenizer splits all numbers into individual digits,\\nand fallbacks to bytes to decompose unknown UTF-8 characters. To deal with variable\\nlength sequences we add a padding token “[[PAD]]” into the LLaMA tokenizer vocabulary.\\nThe resulting vocabulary contains32, 001 tokens.\\nPacking: To optimize the training process and utilize the available computational resources\\nefficiently, we employ the packing technique [26].

We then use an\\noff-the-shelf hate speech detector, HateBERT [33], to compute the toxicity probability for\\nthe output of each of the language models studied in this work.

Our research suggests that\\nsmaller models’ abilities are frequently overstated when compared to advanced models like\\nChatGPT and GPT-4.

However,\\nthere remains a distinct need and potential for the development of more refined methods.\\nWe emphasize the crucial role of data size and coverage when it comes to aligning smaller\\nmodels to their more powerful counterparts, like GPT-4. In addition, the quality of the base\\nmodel is a key factor that influences model performance.\\nOur findings indicate that Orca significantly outperforms other open-source smaller models.\\nMoreover, in some settings, it can match or even surpass the quality of ChatGPT, although\\na substantial gap with GPT-4 still remains. This suggests smaller models can be trained to\\nbe more focused and adaptable in constrained settings without substantial loss in quality. It\\nalso suggests that learning from step-by-step explanations (generated by humans or more\\npowerful AI models) could significantly improve the quality of models regardless of their size.\\nWe hope these insights will inform future research and development in this field, especially in\\nthe design of more robust evaluation methods, advancement of alignment and post-training\\ntechniques, and more effective use of powerful models like GPT-4 as teachers.\\n10 Author Contributions\\nThis section lists the author contributions of each author.\\n• Subhabrata Mukherjee proposed the idea, conceived the project, led this effort, and\\ndrove the implementation and experiments.

Lifespan: The average human lifespan is approximately 72 years.\\nNow, let’s calculate the average number of blinks in a lifetime:\\n1. First, we need to determine the number of minutes in 72 years.

Finally, we need to choose the appropriate estimate based on the given range. For our\\nanswer, we will use the lower estimate of 64,800 blinks.\\nSo, the average number of times a human blinks in a lifetime is approximately 64,800 blinks.\\n### Vicuna:\\nThe average human blinks about 20-25 times per minute, which means they blink about 1.5\\nto 2 million times per year. Over the course of an average human lifespan of 80 years, this\\nwould equate to approximately 120,000,000 to 160,000,000 blinks.\\nTo arrive at this estimate, we can use the following reasoning:\\n1. The average blink duration is about 0.3 seconds. This is based on studies that have\\nmeasured the duration of eye closure during sleep and during wakefulness.\\n2. The average person spends about 6-8 hours per day sleeping, and about 16 hours per day\\nawake and alert. This means that during the day, a person blinks about 16 x 0.3 = 4.8\\nmillion times.\\n3. The average lifespan is about 80 years. This means that a person spends about 80 x\\n365.25 x 24 = 2,922,000 hours awake and alert during their lifetime.\\n4. To calculate the total number of blinks during a lifetime, we can multiply the number of\\nblinks per day (4.8 million) by the number of hours spent awake and alert during a lifetime\\n(2,922,000). This gives us a total of 14,084,400,000 blinks.\\n5. However, this estimate is based on the assumption that blink rate remains constant\\nthroughout a person’s lifetime. In reality, blink rate can vary depending on factors such as\\nage, health, and medication use. Therefore, the actual number of blinks in a lifetime may\\nbe higher or lower than our estimate.\\n### ChatGPT:\\nThe average human blinks about 15-20 times per minute, which translates to approximately\\n1,200 times per hour, 28,800 times per day, and 10,512,000 times per year.\\nAssuming an average lifespan of 80 years, we can calculate the total number of blinks\\nin a lifetime by multiplying the number of blinks per year by the number of years in a lifetime:\\n10,512,000 blinks per year x 80 years = 840,960,000 blinks in a lifetime\\nTherefore, the average human blinks approximately 840 million times in their lifetime.\\nHowever, it’s important to note that this number can vary depending on factors such as age,\\nhealth, and environment.\\n### GPT-4:\\nTo estimate the number of times an average human blinks in a lifetime, we need to consider\\nthe average blink rate, the number of hours a person is awake per day, and the average\\nhuman lifespan.
